## bootstrapBundle

This is an **asynchronous promise plugin**.  This means that the function
should return a promise that resolves to the expected value.

## buildOutput

Given a stream of bundles, reduces those bundles down into a promise that
resolves into a final compilation object.

This compilation object will have three key/value pairs:
