Something about Pluggable.CONTINUE...

## bootstrapBundle

This is a **synchronous pluggable**, which means that the function should return
a real value, rather than a promise or a stream.

This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/bundles/bootstrap.js#L9-L18).

## bootstrapBundles

This is an **asynchronous stream plugin**.  This means that the function should
return a stream that emits expected values.

This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/bundles/bootstrap.js#L29).
The function that it wraps can be found [here](../lib/compile/bundles/bootstrap.js#L20-L27).

## bootstrapCompilation

This is a **synchronous pluggable**, which means that the function should return
a real value, rather than a promise or a stream.

This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/index.js#L14-L21).

## buildOutput

Given a stream of bundles, reduces those bundles down into a promise that
resolves into a final compilation object.

This compilation object will have three key/value pairs:

- `cache`, containing populated cache from the compilation;
- `bundles`, a mapping of destination paths to `raw` code; and
- `opts`, the original options passed to the compilation).

This is an **asynchronous promise plugin**.  This means that the function
should return a promise that resolves to the expected value.

|     | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Parameter | **bundles** | Stream | Bundles generated by [getBundles](#getbundles). |
| Return value |  | Promise | of destination paths to bundles with raw code. |


This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/index.js#L79-L111).

## compile

Performs and end-to-end compilation.  Its return value is a promise
that will resolve to the output of [buildOutput](#buildoutput).

This is an **asynchronous promise plugin**.  This means that the function
should return a promise that resolves to the expected value.

|     | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Return value |  | Promise | Resolves to the compilation output. |

The function that it wraps can be found [here](../lib/compile/bundles/dedupe-implicit.js#L38-L43).

## getBundles

This is a **synchronous pluggable**, which means that the function should return
a real value, rather than a promise or a stream.

This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/index.js#L35-L56).

## getModuleMaps

This is an **asynchronous promise plugin**.  This means that the function
should return a promise that resolves to the expected value.

This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/index.js#L23-L33).

## getUrls

This is an **asynchronous promise plugin**.  This means that the function
should return a promise that resolves to the expected value.

This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/index.js#L58-L63).

## hashBundle

Calculate the bundle's hash.  Defers to [updateBundleHash](#updatebundlehash) for
the actual calculations.

This is a **synchronous pluggable**, which means that the function should return
a real value, rather than a promise or a stream.

|     | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Parameter | **bundle** | Object | Bundle. |
| Return value |  | String | SHA1 that uniquely identifies the bundle. |
