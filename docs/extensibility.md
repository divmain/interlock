Something about Pluggable.CONTINUE...

## bootstrapBundle

This is an **asynchronous promise plugin**.  This means that the function
should return a promise that resolves to the expected value.

This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/bundles/bootstrap.js#L9-L20).

## bootstrapBundles

This is an **asynchronous stream plugin**.  This means that the function should
return a stream that emits expected values.

This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/bundles/bootstrap.js#L33).
The function that it wraps can be found [here](../lib/compile/bundles/bootstrap.js#L22-L31).

## bootstrapCompilation

This is an **asynchronous promise plugin**.  This means that the function
should return a promise that resolves to the expected value.

This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/index.js#L15-L22).

## buildOutput

Given a stream of bundles, reduces those bundles down into a promise that
resolves into a final compilation object.

This compilation object will have three key/value pairs:

- `cache`, containing populated cache from the compilation;
- `bundles`, a mapping of destination paths to `raw` code; and
- `opts`, the original options passed to the compilation).

This is an **asynchronous promise plugin**.  This means that the function
should return a promise that resolves to the expected value.

|     | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Parameter | **bundles** | Stream | Bundles generated by [getBundles](#getbundles). |
| Return value |  | Promise | of destination paths to bundles with raw code. |


This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/index.js#L83-L115).

## compile

Performs and end-to-end compilation.  Its return value is a promise
that will resolve to the output of [buildOutput](#buildoutput).

## hashBundle

Calculate the bundle's hash.  Defers to [updateBundleHash](#updatebundlehash) for
the actual calculations.

This is an **asynchronous promise plugin**.  This means that the function
should return a promise that resolves to the expected value.

|     | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |

This Pluggable's definition can be found [here](../lib/compile/modules/resolve.js#L18-L20).

## readSource

This function is invoked whenever the compiler attempts to read a source-file
from the disk.  It takes an asset object as its only input.  The properties
available on that asset object are as follows:

- `path` - the absolute path of the file
- `ns` - the namespace of the module (either the default ns, or borrowed from its
containing package)
- `nsRoot` - the absolute path to the root of the namespace
- `nsPath` - the file's path relative to the root of the namespace
- `rawSource` - `null`, this value is provided by the `readSource` function
- `ast` - `null`, this value will be populated later in the compilation
- `requireNodes` - `null`, this value will be populated later in the compilation
- `dependencies` - `null`, this value will be populated later in the compilation
- `hash` - `null`, this value will be populated later in the compilation
